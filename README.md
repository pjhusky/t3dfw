# Tiny 3D Framework

Tiny framework meant to be included directly "alongside" your application. 

# Quick Start

In your new application, run
    
	git submodule add https://github.com/pjhusky/t3dfw.git t3dfw

while in the project's root directory. This adds the framework to the folder t3dfw inside your project's root folder. Note that for this to work, your appliation must already be a valid git repository, e.g., you must run `git init` or clone another git repo beforehand.
